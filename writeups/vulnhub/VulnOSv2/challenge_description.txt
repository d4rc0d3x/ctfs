VulnOS are a series of vulnerable operating systems packed as virtual images to enhance penetration testing skills

This is version 2 -

Smaller, less chaotic !

As time is not always on my side, It took a long time to create another VulnOS. But I like creating them. The image is build with VBOX. Unpack the file and add it to your virtualisation software.

Your assignment is to pentest a company website, get root of the system and read the final flag

NOTE : current keyboard preferences is BE "pentesting is a wide concept"
